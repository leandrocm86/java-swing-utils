# java-swing-utils
A small and simple API aiming to help building apps with Swing.
With these utilities it is possible to:

- Create frames with icons in system tray (classes SystemTrayFrame and Widget);
- Create toast/snackbar alerts (class Toast);
- Create complex components such as JScrollPane and buttons with images (class SwingComponents);
- Easily customizing and scaling regular Swing components with background and fonts (classes CustomFont and SwingComponents);
- Easily retrieving the display's width and height (class Screen);
- Easily arranging components positions with proportionate layouts (class RelativeLayout);

All this with less code and boilerplate, reducing the effort for using Swing.
